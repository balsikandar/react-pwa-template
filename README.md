## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Yarn is recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.combalsikandar/react-pwa-template.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd react-pwa-template
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   npm install #or yarn
   ```

### Development
Start the development server
   ```
   npm start
   or
   yarn start
   ```
This will launch the development server at http://localhost:3000. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger hot module replacement.

### Building for Production
To create a production-ready build of your app, run the following command:

   ```
   npm run build
   or
   yarn build
   ```
This will generate optimized production files in the build directory.

### Deploying
You can deploy your PWA to your preferred hosting platform. Simply upload the contents of the build directory to your server.

### Customization
Update the public/manifest.json file with your app's details.
Add your own components, styles, and routes to build your app.
Customize the service worker in the src/service-worker.ts file to cache specific assets or data.
